I was bored so i made this project for fun, i also used this to familiarize myself with git and github

For running the python version (If you dont have python use Packaged.zip) you need to download Music.mp3, DAT_200.asciidata and Display_AsciiDat.py, put all 3 in the same folder and run the python code üëç

# Running "Packaged.zip"

For packaged, unzip and then run the .exe, and enjoy!
